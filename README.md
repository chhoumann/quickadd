## Getting started
The first thing you'll want to do is add a new choice. A choice can be one of four types.
- [Template Choice](docs/Choices/TemplateChoice.md) - A powerful way to insert templates into your vault.
- [Capture Choice](docs/Choices/CaptureChoice.md) - Quick capture anything, anywhere.
- [Macro Choice](docs/Choices/MacroChoice.md) - Macros to augment your workflow. Do more, faster.
- [Multi Choice](docs/Choices/MultiChoice.md) - Organize your choices in folders.

In your choices, you can use [format syntax](docs/FormatSyntax.md), which is similar to the Obsidian template syntax.

You could, for example, use ``{{DATE}}`` to get the current date.
