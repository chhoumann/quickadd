## Installation
**This plugin is in the community plugin browser in Obsidian**. You can search for it and install it there .

You can also do a [manual installation](docs/ManualInstallation.md).

## What's new?
### 0.2.14 - 0.2.15
- Add 'Insert at the end of section' feature to Captures.
- Revamped the Capture & Template format suggesters. They're now more like smart-autocompleters.

### 0.2.13
- Add error logging for when no macro is in the choice.
- Add 'Add' buttons to Macro Builder.
- Multi choices can now have commands & hotkeys.
- Attempted to address #39 - capture not creating template.
- Suggest files from both core templates folder and templater templates folder when creating a Template choice.
- Fix bug where, if there is an emoji in the folder name, the file sometimes doesn't get created
- Update the API. The suggester can now take a map function for the `displayItems`, which will be executed on the `actualItems`. There is also a utility module now, which currently allows you to set or get your clipboard.


### 0.2.11 - 0.2.12
- Implement Quick Commands - ironically, starting with a Wait command. With this command, you can add a delay to your macros. Useful for commands that may take a while to finish.
- Fix a bug where the command sequence did not save.
- Fix bug where 'Create file if it doesn't exist' did not work as intended when no template was given.
- Updated the documentation with new examples and changes to settings.
- Remove (missed) `console.log`.
- If formatted content is empty, don't add anything.
- Capture: Don't create file if setting is disabled.

### 0.2.9 - 0.2.10
- Fix Capture 'Create file if it doesn't exist' bug where some Templater functions did not activate
- Address #28 - choices in multis were not able to be added as commands
- Implement #29 - you can now capture to the bottom of a file
- Fix macro ID conversion
- Fix select macro bug for users with 0-1 macros

### 0.2.7 - 0.2.8
- Linebreak formatting no longer occurs in Template choices - it only activates for Capture choices. It caused unnecessary conflicts.
- Fix bug where some Templater functions are activated twice.

## Getting started
The first thing you'll want to do is add a new choice. A choice can be one of four types.
- [Template Choice](docs/Choices/TemplateChoice.md) - A powerful way to insert templates into your vault.
- [Capture Choice](docs/Choices/CaptureChoice.md) - Quick capture anything, anywhere.
- [Macro Choice](docs/Choices/MacroChoice.md) - Macros to augment your workflow. Do more, faster.
- [Multi Choice](docs/Choices/MultiChoice.md) - Organize your choices in folders.

In your choices, you can use [format syntax](docs/FormatSyntax.md), which is similar to the Obsidian template syntax.

You could, for example, use ``{{DATE}}`` to get the current date.
