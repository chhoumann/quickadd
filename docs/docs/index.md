## Installation

**This plugin is in the community plugin browser in Obsidian**. You can search for it and install it there .

You can also do a [manual installation](./ManualInstallation).

## First steps

The first thing you'll want to do is add a new choice. A choice can be one of four types.

-   [Template Choice](./Choices/TemplateChoice) - Insert templates into your vault. Works together with Obsidian template syntax and popular _Templater_ plugin, augmenting them and adding more options.
-   [Capture Choice](./Choices/CaptureChoice) - Quick capture your manually written information and save it. Daily notes, work log, to-read-and-watch-later list, etc.
-   [Macro Choice](./Choices/MacroChoice) - Macros to augment your workflow. Use the full power of Javascript programming language and Obsidian functions to do anything your want. E.g. [create a personal movie database](./Examples/Macro_MovieAndSeriesScript) by writing a movie name and getting the movie notes fully customized and filled with correct film's up-to-date data.
-   [Multi Choice](./Choices/MultiChoice) - Folders to better organize the previous 3 choices. Usability feature, not a new functionality.

In your choices, you can use [format syntax](./FormatSyntax), which is similar to the Obsidian template syntax.

You could, for example, use `{{DATE}}` to get the current date.

QuickAdd also features a powerful [suggester system](./SuggesterSystem) that provides intelligent, fuzzy-search suggestions for files, tags, headings, and more.
